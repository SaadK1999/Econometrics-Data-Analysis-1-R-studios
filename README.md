# R-Studios-Project-1
Econometrics First project

Hi, this is my first Econometrics data analysis project :) 

In this project, I do a multiple regression analysis of Hourly Earning to Age with indicator variables to compare earnings for males and female, as well as their respective level of education.

CPS15_96 is the data set in Excel

"ps5" is the code I wrote in R studios

The Report is where I do some analysis on internal validity. I then display my regressions and graphs in this report
